Galaxy light's demo guide

for right now just dubble clicking on the "runcolorcycle.PY" file and pressing play 
is the best option and pretty much the only demo that's fun to run. The "galaxy.py" file
might be usefull for pictures as it's simply solid white lights. 

Still looking in on how to get a demo running at start up.
