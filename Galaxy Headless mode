Running Galaxy lights in headless mode

To run the Galaxy lights in headless mode (script runs when the pi turns on without neededing a screen)
you will need to edit rc.local system file on your raspberry pi. 

since rc.local is a system file you will need root access to edit it. 

Using the comand terminal type

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

this will open rc.local to be edited. Add comamands below the comment
but leave the line exit 0 at the end. 

Example:

#
#
sudo python /home/pi/Downloads/ZebraGalaxy-master/galaxy.py &

exit 0

to save changes hold Ctrl + X 
then press Y and Enter to save changes


Tips:  

	always add an ampersand (&) to the end of a looping script such as the Galaxy.py and runcolorcyle.py scripts
The ampersand allows the command to run in a separate process and contunie to boot, with out it the script
Will not end and the pi will not boot up.

	The command line is the full path name of what script you wish to run 
if you have moved the file from the defualt downloads folder you will need to locate the file
location and change the command path, for example if it was moved to the desktop the path might look like /home/pi/Desktop/ZebraGalaxy-master/galaxy.py

	Check the script you want to run in python before setting it to run in headless mode
if for some reason the script runs fine in python's shell but not in headless mode check to make
sure the propper path was writen down
