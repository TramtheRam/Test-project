Learning how to use get hub

The following is an import of the c4 galaxy light chip instructions

ZebraGalaxy
The evolving code of the Zebra Galaxy LED board for Raspberry Pi
Learning how to use get hub
The Zebra Galaxy circuit board leverages a pure Python library for the APA102 RGB LED made by “tinue (Martin)” a Swiss programmer. 
His excellent library leverages the Adafruit GPIO library. 

The orginal GPIO libraries have been included with the latest Galaxy files
however should you want the libraries and setup instructons they can be found at 

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO


We have included here the APA102 library as well as Martin’s test scripts.  If you want to separately get the latest version of his project you can find it here:

https://github.com/tinue/APA102_Pi

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before beginning, make sure your Raspberry Pi is configured to use SPI. 
That can be set in "Preferences" "Rasspberry pi configuration" then under the Interfaces tab select Enable on SPI:
Then reboot.

For installation of the Galaxy clone or download the Galaxy project folder from https://github.com/theC4Labs/ZebraGalaxy 


To activate the 18 LEDs, simply run the “Galaxy.py” script or the “runcolorcycle.py” to see a demo

To change the color and behavior of the LEDs, modify the script and reboot or kill the process and restart.

Tip: 

	It is highly recomeneded to make a coppy of any files you are planing to edit, for example if you wish to change the "Galaxy.py" script make a copy named
"Galaxy2.py" that way if anything goes wrong in the edits you still have a working file to go back to.

Running Galaxy lights in headless mode

To run the Galaxy lights in headless mode (script runs when the pi turns on without neededing a screen)
you will need to edit rc.local system file on your raspberry pi. 

since rc.local is a system file you will need root access to edit it. 

Using the comand terminal type

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

this will open rc.local to be edited. Add comamands below the comment
but leave the line exit 0 at the end. 

Example:

#
#
sudo python /home/pi/Downloads/ZebraGalaxy-master/galaxy.py &

exit 0

to save changes hold Ctrl + X 
then press Y and Enter to save changes


Tips:  

	always add an ampersand (&) to the end of a looping script such as the Galaxy.py and runcolorcyle.py scripts
The ampersand allows the command to run in a separate process and contunie to boot, with out it the script
Will not end and the pi will not boot up.

	The command line is the full path name of what script you wish to run 
if you have moved the file from the defualt downloads folder you will need to locate the file
location and change the command path, for example if it was moved to the desktop the path might look like /home/pi/Desktop/ZebraGalaxy-master/galaxy.py

	Check the script you want to run in python before setting it to run in headless mode
if for some reason the script runs fine in python's shell but not in headless mode check to make
sure the propper path was writen down
